-- `Menu`
-- It is one of the last things I will need to mess around with. I'm happy and surprised everything works so far.
-- For sure I have learnt a lot about lua during this journey. Still a lot ahead. I will continue writing in the same style though, to not make it even worse.

-- WHOLE CODE HAS FLAG OF "need a cleanup"

-- Metatable of `Menu`
Menu = {}

-- Constructor of `Menu`
function Menu:new ()
end
